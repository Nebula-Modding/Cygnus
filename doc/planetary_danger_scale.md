# Planetary Danger Scale

Cygnus contains a system to alert players of dangerous planets *before*
launching to them. The navigation menu can provide a list of warnings about
planets and uses a colour code to indicate danger.

To determine *how* dangerous your planet is, you can use this scale!

This scale is mostly just for fun, but you should still utilize it for your
planets so that players can quickly tell just how dangerous your planet is.

> Note: Any *external threats* (i.e, Sith occupation, Ra from Stargate,
> Viltrumite occupation, etc.) are to be disregarded from the danger scale. Any
> *internal* threats (i.e, hostile population [a la Ewoks, Viltrumites],
> planetary civil war [a al Naboo {Jar Jar's species against... whatever other
> species is there}, *1984*], **global** dystopian environments [*1984*,
> *Scythe*]).

## Habitable

- Breathable atmosphere
- Easily-accessible water (i.e, oceans)
- Temperature and humidity are safe
- Farmable soil
- Safe amounts of radiation

## Safe

- Breathable atmosphere
- May or may not have water that is easily-accessible
- Temperature and humidity are safe
- Soil may or may not be farmable
- Atmosphere is safe to equipment
- Safe amounts of radiation
- Any other condition that makes the planet otherwise unhabitable

## Euclid

- Atmosphere may or may not be breathable
- Water is very difficult to access or there is no water
- Temperature and/or humidity may be lethal without equipment
- Soil may or may not be farmable
- Atmosphere is safe to space suits
- Safe or mildly-dangerous amounts of radiation
- Any other condition that makes the planet unsafe without equipment

## Lethal

- Non-breathable atmosphere
- No water
- Temperature and/or humidity are very often or always lethal without equipment (or even with equipment)
- Soil is not farmable
- Atmosphere damages space suits
- Lethal radiation
- Any other condition that makes the planet unsafe even with equipment

## Non-Landable

If a planet cannot be landed on, use this instead of safe/euclid/lethal.

## Examples

### Earth

**Classification:** Habitable

- Breathable atmosphere
- Abundant water
- Temperature and humidity are generally safe
  - Exceptions are deserts, polar regions, and regions of high temperatures and high humidity
- Plenty of farmable soil
- Atmosphere is safe for equipment
- Radiation is safe

### Stargate's Planet (*Stargate*, the original one)

**Classification:** Habitable

- Breathable atmosphere
- Water seems to be mildly scarce but the population is large enough to assume they have access to water
- Temperature is high but generally safe
- Soil may or may not be farmable, if not there is plenty of wildlife to hunt for food
- Atmosphere is safe for equipment
- Radiation is safe

### Arrakis (*Dune*)

**Classification:** Euclid

- Breathable atmosphere
- Very scarce water
- High temperature and low humidity
- Little farmable soil
- Atmosphere is safe for equipment
- Radiation is safe
- Sandworms.

### Mustafar (*Star Wars*)

**Classification:** Lethal

- Breathable with a potential side of pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcaniconiosis
- No water
- Very high temperature
- No farmable soil
- Atmosphere is safe for equipment
- Radiation is safe (as far as we know)
- Volcanoes and magma everywhere

### Hoth (*Star Wars*)

**Classification:** Euclid

- Breathable
- Icy planet, so water is accessible with equipment
- Cold temperature
- Not much farmable soil, if any
- Atmosphere is safe for equipment
- Radiation is safe
- Semi-dangerous wildlife

### Interstellar Examples

<details>
<summary>Examples from Interstellar (spoilers!)</summary>

### Miller's Planet

**Classification:** Lethal

- Breathable atmosphere (as far as we could tell)
- Abundant water
- Temperature+humidity unknown
- Little-to-no land (i.e, little-to-no soil for farming)
- Atmosphere is safe to equipment
- Radiation is safe (as far as we could tell)
- The ocean's waves are huge and dangerous to life and equipment
  - This single point is enough to make the planet's classification be lethal

### Mann's Planet

**Classification:** Euclid

- Non-breathable atmosphere
- No water (as far as we could tell)
- Temperature is very cold
  - Exact temperature ranges are unknown, though ammonia freezes at -77.7Â°C, which is way too cold for human life
- Atmosphere is safe for equipment
- Radiation is safe (as far as we could tell)

## Edmund's Planet

**Classification:** Habitable

- Breathable atmosphere
- Water
  - We could not see any water from the images provided in the movie, but we *do* see clouds, which we assume are water
- Temperature is safe
- Atmosphere is safe for equipment
- Radiation is safe (as far as we could tell)
